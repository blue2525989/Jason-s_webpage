	<p>Welcome to my first web application,
	on this page I hope to show off some of my programming skills. I love Java programming and similar
	 languages. I have tried Python and a little C &amp; C++. 
	 I hope to be a software engineer in the near future. 
	 I really enjoy solving problems and writing software that people enjoy. Writing applications that involve 
	 databases are becoming my favorite. The ability to organize data is impressive. I do enjoy 
	 writing stand alone applications, but I see how important web applications are in todays business world and 
	 enjoy that side as well.
	</p>
	
	<p>I am starting to learn to use linux more in depth. I have been trying to learn to write scripts 
	to automate simple tasks on my computer. I also enjoy working from the terminal. 
	</p>
