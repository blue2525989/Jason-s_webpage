        This consists of two card games, five-card poker and blackjack. When the application starts 
        the user is prompted to select which game they want to play. I have found myself playing these games 
        for large chunks of time, surprisingly fun for text based games.<br /><br />
        
        Here is a link to the source code, <a href="https://github.com/blue2525989/Card_Games">GitHub</a>
        <br /><br />
        
        I started writing blackjack first and based it off a version I wrote in Python. I wanted to 
        add some visual elements so I re-wrote it in Java. There is a 'yes' button which lets you 
        take a hit. Also there is a 'no' button which makes the dealer take his turn and displays the 
        winner.<br /><br />
        
        I enjoyed making the blackjack game so much I decided to make another card game whose model inherited 
        from the original games model, so I made a PokerCard class and ended up dividing my original Card class 
        down even more into Card class and BlackjackCard class.
        In poker there is a 'deal' button which deals the cards. A 'hit' button where you can choose the 
        number of cards to trade and their spots in your hand, And a 'call' button which will cause the 
        dealer to take his turn and then display the winner.
        
        This is the main loading screen where the user chooses which game to play.
       
        This is the main screen before the cards are dealt.
        
        Notice the score shows I have two of a kind and so does the dealer So I will take a hit.
        
        The dealer ended up getting three of a kind even though I got two pairs after my hit. Dealer wins.
        
        Here is the main screen of blackjack before the deal button is pressed.
        
        Once the cards are dealt I have 17 and the dealer has 16. The dealer is programmed to hit until 
        his total is over 17 so I will stay in hopes that he bust.
       
        No such luck! The dealer ended up getting a four of clubs which gives him a total of 20!<br /><br />
        Maybe next game the cards will be better.
