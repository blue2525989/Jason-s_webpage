        This consists of two card games, five-card poker and blackjack. When the application starts 
        the user is prompted to select which game they want to play. I have found myself playing these games 
        for large chunks of time, surprisingly fun for text based games.<br /><br />
        
        Here is a link to the source code, <a href="https://github.com/blue2525989/Card_Games">GitHub</a>
        <br /><br />
        
        I started writing blackjack first and based it off a version I wrote in Python. I wanted to 
        add some visual elements so I re-wrote it in Java. There is a 'yes' button which lets you 
        take a hit. Also there is a 'no' button which makes the dealer take his turn and displays the 
        winner.<br /><br />
        
        I enjoyed making the blackjack game so much I decided to make another card game whose model inherited 
        from the original games model, so I made a PokerCard class and ended up dividing my original Card class 
        down even more into Card class and BlackjackCard class.
        In poker there is a 'deal' button which deals the cards. A 'hit' button where you can choose the 
        number of cards to trade and their spots in your hand, And a 'call' button which will cause the 
        dealer to take his turn and then display the winner.
        <br/><br/>
        This is the main loading screen where the user chooses which game to play.
       <br/><br/>
        This is the main screen before the cards are dealt.
        <br/><br/>
        Notice the score shows I have two of a kind and so does the dealer So I will take a hit.
        <br/><br/>
        The dealer ended up getting three of a kind even though I got two pairs after my hit. Dealer wins.
        <br/><br/>
        Here is the main screen of blackjack before the deal button is pressed.
        <br/><br/>
        Once the cards are dealt I have 17 and the dealer has 16. The dealer is programmed to hit until 
        his total is over 17 so I will stay in hopes that he bust.
       <br/><br/>
        No such luck! The dealer ended up getting a four of clubs which gives him a total of 20!<br /><br />
        Maybe next game the cards will be better.
