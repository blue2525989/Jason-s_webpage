# Jason-s_webpage
Java web application using Spring boot + gradle, hosted on aws

URL: http://sample-env-3.i3ywvhk4um.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

This dynamic web application uses Spring boot framework, thymeleaf, MySQL and gradle.

It is just a simple about me website that has a calculator and a fun with text page where you can send messages to an array or a string and reverse them or replace characters and other various things. There is a guestbook where users can fill out their info if they want to.

As of April 2nd, I got the create login working in this application so I will no longer need the helper application to access the database and create new users.
