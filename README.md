Java web application using Spring boot + gradle, hosted on aws

URL: http://sample-env-3.i3ywvhk4um.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/index.html

I am currently working on tracking down a good domain name for this.

As it stands now this web application is built in Java using hte Spring Boot framework. I have also
employed the gradle build system and connected to a MySQL database that is also being hosted on aws.

For now the MySQL instance is only used for the Guestbook page where clients can enter thier name and 
other various information about themselves and save it.
